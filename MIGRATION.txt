# SDL3 MIGRATION

## New Possibilities (ideas from during porting process)

- SDL_gpu new renderer with shaders and lighting
- drag and drop events to enable unity style references
    - or also opening scene files
- SDL_SetRenderLogicalPresentation might do the letterboxing auto
- SDL_ttf LCD, solid, etc WHAT IS THIS?

## TODO

- honestly, you should take the chance to deprecate old logging and error enums, etc
- you probably have to update the lua key bindings
- double triple check the nuklear thing- I totally made that fix up and still cant test because it wont compile LOL
