/**
 * @file cache.h
 * @brief The engine API for caching resources
 * 
 * Cache System:
 * The goal of this cache system is to be something that supports the engine for the long term. The chosen paradigm is that of a refcount-less cache, which accumulates
 * items either manually, or from pre loaded files. The public API supports getting resources from the cache (if existant) through functions like `ye_image` and `ye_font`.
 * There are also functions for manually adding resources to the cache, such as `ye_create_texture` and `ye_create_font`.
 * The cache is only explicitely cleared when ye_clear_*_cache is called, which will free all cached resources of specified type.
 * Normally, the scene manager will just clear the texture cache between scenes. The font and color cache will be cleared when the engine is shut down.
 * 
 * This cache paradigm suits the intended use of the engine, as I envision loading all scene assets up front, and then clearing them when the scene is unloaded.
 * To minimize the overhead of loading textures that might not need to be cleared on scene switch, `ye_pre_cache_scene` will reuse duplicate textures that have
 * already been cached when switching scenes.
 * 
 * Pre caching a scene will be opt-in, and will be done by the scene manager. In the case of very large scenes, the developer can still load textures on demand,
 * but will still need to find a way to pre-cache all their fonts and colors as needed.
 * 
 * The low level api does allow for deletion of individual resources, but I'm only including this for edge case compatibility, as I wont be using it for the purpose of
 * my games (yet).
 * 
 * The cache is implemented using UTHASH for simplicity and
 * 
 * The cache is very opt in, as you are only required to pass the pointers to resources when constructing ECS
 * components, meaning you could forgo the cache entirely and manually manage your memory. This is not recommended.
 * 
 * Tracking cache size:
 * 
 * This could be pretty easily done, but its not strictly necessary and will add overhead (unless optimized out)
 * It could be done like this if ever needed:
 * 
 * int ye_texture_size(SDL_Texture *texture){
 *    int w, h;
 *   SDL_QueryTexture(texture, NULL, NULL, &w, &h);
 *   return w * h * 4;
 * }
 * 
 * TODO:
 * - destruction of individual cache items
 * - caching of scene files
 * 
 * SHAPING:
 * scene.yoyo files can specify a styles.yoyo that it is dependant on... which scene manager can auto load
