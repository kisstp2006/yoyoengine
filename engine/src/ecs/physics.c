    Physics system

    Acts upon the list of tracked entities with physics components and updates their
    position based on their velocity and acceleration. Multiply by delta time to get
    the actual change in position. (engine_runtime_state.frame_time).

    Currently, we will always do CCD (continuous collision detection) for all entities with physics.
    In the future, a great optimization would be to only perform CCD for entities meeting certain velocity
    thresholds, or if we are below a certain framerate. We could also expose a bool for CCD on the physics
    component to allow more fine grained control, as well as an integer for specifying the number of steps.

    TODO/Considerations:
    - maybe we want to check for hitting multiple overlapping triggers?
    - trigger colliders are needed

    Physics entities need a transform component to work, we apply these forces to the transform not the component position.
